# Web-Development-Project
Web development project completed showcasing multi-web page layout that uses features of links, grid and photographs. Web design was first created in 'Figma,' graphic design software and then the webassignment.png file contains an image of the file before it was designed for the project.

The zip file contains:
- Course.html
- assignment.css
- programming.html
- contact.html
- networking.html
- websitedesign&development.html
- index.html
- managingasuccessfulproject.html
- networking&security.html
- networking.html
- programming.html
- proect.html
- security.html
- softwarelifecycle.html
- Databasedesign&development.html

I also add individual files for individual inspection as well.
